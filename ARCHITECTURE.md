# Architecture

This document is a compact map of how the extension works.

It is written for both human readers and code-reading agents that need to answer questions like:

- where is provider payload patching done?
- where is remote compaction called?
- where is state persisted vs cached?
- how do normal turns differ from post-compaction turns?

## Design goal

The package adds **OpenAI-native continuity** to Pi for supported OpenAI-compatible Responses models while still preserving Pi's normal local session semantics.

In practice, that means keeping two representations of context alive at once:

1. **Portable Pi representation**
   - normal Pi session JSONL entries
   - a readable text compaction summary
   - used for Pi features like resume, branch/tree operations, model switching, and non-OpenAI replay

2. **OpenAI-native representation**
   - for direct `openai/*`: `previous_response_id` for live continuation when safe
   - for supported backends: opaque replacement history returned by Responses compaction v2
   - used only for compatible future OpenAI, OpenAI Codex or Copilot OpenAI Responses turns

## High-level flow

### Normal supported turn

1. Pi prepares a provider request.
2. `src/index.ts` handles `before_provider_request`.
3. For direct `openai/*`, `src/openai.ts` patches the payload with:
   - `store: true`
   - `context_management`
   - maybe `previous_response_id`
4. For direct `openai/*`, the registered provider override in `src/custom-stream.ts` chooses the custom WS-backed stream.
5. `src/openai-ws-stream.ts` either:
   - sends the request over the OpenAI Responses WebSocket transport, or
   - falls back to Pi's default HTTP Responses streaming path.
6. For `openai-codex/*` and Copilot OpenAI Responses models, the extension leaves the built-in provider transport alone and only injects reconstructed remote-compaction history when needed. Replay preserves the current system/developer messages and tool declarations.
7. When a compatible assistant message completes, `src/index.ts` records the new `responseId` as continuation state only for the backends that support `previous_response_id`.

### Compaction turn

1. Pi decides to compact or receives an explicit compact command.
2. `src/index.ts` handles `session_before_compact` and resolves request credentials, headers and any account-specific endpoint through Pi's model registry.
3. In parallel, it tries to:
   - generate a **portable local summary**
   - request Responses compaction v2
4. `src/remote-compaction.ts` converts Pi messages to OpenAI Responses `input` items, appends a `compaction_trigger`, and streams the compaction response from the normal Responses endpoint.
5. If remote compaction succeeds, the returned opaque replacement history is stored in:
   - `CompactionEntry.details.remoteCompaction`
6. Pi still keeps a text summary so the session remains understandable and portable. Remote failure warns before falling back to text compaction; cancellation never returns a checkpoint. Failed or incomplete text summaries are not treated as successful compaction.

### Post-compaction continuation

For later direct OpenAI Responses turns, the extension prefers:

- the persisted/reconstructed remote replacement history, when model-compatible
- otherwise safe live continuation using `previous_response_id`
- otherwise ordinary full-input replay / Pi fallback behavior

## Persisted state vs runtime state

### Persisted in Pi session history

Persisted state lives in the session JSONL file and survives reloads:

- normal Pi `message` entries
- Pi `compaction` entries
- `compaction.details.remoteCompaction`

The persisted `remoteCompaction` payload is the important bridge to Codex-style behavior. Version 2 contains retained user messages plus the opaque `compaction` item returned by Responses compaction v2. Version 1 entries from the legacy `/responses/compact` implementation remain readable for session compatibility.

### Runtime-only state

Runtime-only state lives in memory and is rebuilt when needed:

- latest safe `responseId` for incremental continuation
- reconstructed remote compaction replay state for the active session
- active WebSocket session manager(s)

This state is managed by:

- `src/state.ts`
- `src/openai-ws-stream.ts`
- `src/index.ts`

## Key modules

### `src/index.ts`

The orchestration layer.

Responsibilities:
- register the custom provider override
- patch outgoing provider payloads
- hook into Pi compaction lifecycle
- merge local and remote compaction results
- reconstruct remote state on session start/tree/compaction
- clear ephemeral state on switch/fork/tree/model/shutdown

If you want to understand the extension as a whole, start here.

### `src/remote-compaction.ts`

The Codex-style compaction layer.

Responsibilities:
- convert Pi messages to OpenAI Responses-style input items
- call the provider's Responses endpoint with a trailing `compaction_trigger` (`/responses` for Copilot, `/v1/responses` for direct OpenAI)
- preserve Copilot model/authentication headers and identify compaction as agent-initiated
- parse the Responses SSE stream and validate the returned `compaction` item
- retain recent user messages using Codex's 20K-token budget shape
- build portable text summaries
- rebuild replayable remote state from persisted compaction entries

This file is the core of the actual compaction-boundary behavior.

### `src/openai-ws-stream.ts`

The custom stream implementation.

Responsibilities:
- decide between WS path and HTTP fallback
- reuse a live WebSocket session when safe
- send incremental post-turn deltas for direct OpenAI continuation when request shape is unchanged
- replay remote compaction history when available
- translate OpenAI WS events into Pi assistant stream events/messages
- compute usage/cost information for the WS path

### `src/openai-ws-connection.ts`

A thin OpenAI Responses WebSocket client.

Responsibilities:
- connect/authenticate
- emit parsed events
- remember latest completed `response.id`
- reconnect defensively

### `src/openai.ts`

Shared provider-specific helpers.

Responsibilities:
- identify direct OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI Codex and Copilot OpenAI Responses models
- build stable model keys
- patch Responses payloads
- extract assistant `responseId`

### `src/config.ts`

Loads and normalizes configuration from:

- `~/.pi/agent/openai-server-compaction.json`
- `.pi/openai-server-compaction.json`
- environment variables

### `src/state.ts`

Stores ephemeral per-session runtime state only.

It does **not** persist remote compaction artifacts itself. Those live in Pi session entries.

### `src/custom-stream.ts`

Small dispatch layer that enables the custom WS-backed stream only for direct OpenAI Responses models.

### `src/stream-message-shared.ts`

Shared message constructors used by the stream path so generated assistant messages match what Pi expects.

## Safety model

The extension intentionally avoids reusing provider-native continuity blindly.

Important safety rules:

- remote replacement history is only reused for matching provider/API/model keys on supported Responses models
- Copilot credentials are sent only to the model's resolved endpoint; Copilot does not opt into stored-response continuity or the custom WebSocket stream
- in-memory remote history is only extended while the active model still matches the compaction model
- reconstructed remote history only replays post-compaction turns whose assistant completions match the compaction model, avoiding cross-model pollution after resume/tree reload
- live `previous_response_id` state is cleared on key session/model lifecycle boundaries
- HTTP fallback remains available if the WS path is unavailable or unsafe

## Why both local summary and remote compaction exist

A common question is: why not use only the OpenAI-native opaque artifact?

Because Pi still needs local, explicit state for:

- session tree and branch semantics
- readable/exportable session history
- reload/resume behavior that still makes sense outside one provider
- switching away from OpenAI-compatible models

So the package is intentionally hybrid:

- **Pi summary for portability and Pi semantics**
- **OpenAI opaque history for better continuity on compatible later turns**

## Testing strategy

### Runtime smoke

- `npm run smoke`

Verifies imports/loadability.

### Offline Copilot protocol and lifecycle tests

- `npm test`

`tests/copilot.test.mjs` exercises the extension against a loopback HTTP fixture and also runs real Pi RPC subprocesses. It verifies account-specific routing, authentication and vision headers, native replay with current system instructions, model isolation, text fallback, cancellation, and persistence/replay across a process restart. These tests do not prove GitHub's live backend accepts the experimental protocol.

### Live end-to-end test

- `npm run test:live`

Implemented in:
- `tests/live/openai-compaction-rpc-live.ts`

This is a black-box integration test that drives real `pi --mode rpc` sessions and validates:

- same-session continuity after compaction
- model switch away and back
- fork after compaction
- resume/reload after compaction
- reduced-plaintext recall in the same process and after restart, with an extension-disabled negative control

The focused `github-copilot/gpt-6-luna` run passed against the live Copilot backend on Pi 1.1.0. See [Copilot live validation](VALIDATION.md#github-copilot-live-validation) for its scope and reproduction command.
