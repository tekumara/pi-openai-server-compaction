# pi-openai-server-compaction

This is a Pi extension which adds **Codex-style remote compaction** for OpenAI models, giving you better continuity across compaction boundaries while preserving all of Pi's normal features.

What does that mean? Why would you want it? My impression has been that Codex compacts better than Claude Code and better than Pi. And I supposed this was because Codex compacts by using OpenAI's server-side Responses compaction protocol. That protocol sends a `compaction_trigger` through `POST /v1/responses` and receives an encrypted `compaction` item. This extension configures Pi to use that protocol for OpenAI models alongside Pi's native compaction logic.

But is Codex's compaction _actually_ better? Since the OpenAI compaction endpoint compacts to encrypted binary blobs, no one can say what it is doing under the hood. However, we don't need to know how it works to determine if it works better. Anyone can call the endpoint. And since codex is an open source, we can mimic exactly how codex itself uses the endpoint. That is what this extension configures Pi to do.

So is native compaction better? For the user-facing comparison I care about,
the evidence says yes, with important price and reliability qualifiers. A
held-out benchmark of the real product defaults found 78.0% exact recall for
this extension's native policy versus 48.0% for Pi's default compactor; full
context scored 100%. Native did this while emitting 4.58x as many compaction
output tokens and leaving a 29% larger billed downstream context. It preserved
much more old state, but this is not evidence that it is better at the same
token budget.
Native was also highly variable: every large artifact scored perfectly, while
three small artifacts performed about as poorly as Pi.

Strictly, this directly compares Pi with this extension's reconstruction of
Codex-style compaction, not with an end-to-end run of the Codex CLI. The result
also does not show that the endpoint reliably detects when more capacity is
needed: its short artifacts were the failures. What it does show is that the
native default sometimes allocates far more context, and those large-allocation
runs drove its aggregate advantage.

An earlier benchmark reported 100% native recall versus 82.8% and 76.7% for two
text summaries at apparently matched downstream sizes. That procedure first
observed native's output usage and then imposed it as the text arm's maximum,
which is asymmetric and can favor native. Its same-budget interpretation is
therefore superseded. See the new [product-defaults report](benchmarks/product-defaults/REPORT.md)
and [reproduction instructions](benchmarks/product-defaults/README.md). The
[older matched-cap report](benchmarks/native-vs-text/REPORT.md) remains retained
with a methodological correction.

None of this proves the encrypted blobs use a clever latent-space
representation. They might be encrypted optimized text or structured state
values. (A little reverse engineering suggests the blobs are produced through
a textual prompt, for what it is worth:

> **Status:** experimental but live-tested against real Pi + real OpenAI backends.
> Recommended rollout: install project-local first, use for a week, keep rollback easy.

## Install

Project-local (recommended):

```bash
pi install -l git:github.com/algal/pi-openai-server-compaction
```

Global:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/algal/pi-openai-server-compaction
```

One-shot, non-persistent:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/algal/pi-openai-server-compaction.git
cd pi-openai-server-compaction && npm install
pi -e ./src/index.ts --model openai/gpt-5.6-luna
```

## Requirements

- Node `>= 22`
- Pi 1.x (`>=1.1.0`; development and offline integration tests use 1.1.0)
- Auth/config for the model you want to use must already work in Pi
- A supported OpenAI Responses model, e.g. `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` or `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`

## What it does

On compaction, the extension requests Responses compaction v2 through `/v1/responses` in parallel with generating a portable Pi text summary. This gives you both:

- **An OpenAI-native opaque compaction artifact** for high-fidelity continuity on compatible future turns
- **A portable Pi text summary** so non-OpenAI models, session exports, forking, and tree navigation keep working

For direct `openai/*` models between compactions, the extension also:

- Patches requests with `store: true` and `context_management`
- Uses `previous_response_id` for live continuation when safe
- Provides a WebSocket-backed transport path with HTTP fallback

For `openai-codex/*` models, the extension preserves the built-in Codex transport and only injects reconstructed remote compaction history after compaction boundaries.

## How compaction works

On Pi compaction events for supported models, the extension:

1. Generates a **portable Pi text summary** (full-branch summary with fallback to Pi's built-in compaction helper)
2. Calls `POST /v1/responses` with the conversation history, a trailing `compaction_trigger`, system prompt, tools, reasoning config, and text config
3. Retains recent user messages and stores them with the returned opaque `compaction` item in `CompactionEntry.details.remoteCompaction`
4. Persists remote compaction usage metadata when the backend returns it

The compaction request mirrors the shape of surrounding normal requests (reasoning effort, text settings, tool definitions) rather than using endpoint defaults.

## Safety

The extension clears live continuation state on: session start/reload/resume, switch/fork, tree navigation, compaction completion, model selection, and shutdown.

Remote compaction history is only replayed for compatible models. Cross-model turns are filtered from reconstructed replay history to prevent contamination after resume or tree navigation.

## Data handling

Users should be aware:

- For direct `openai/*` models, the extension sets `store: true` on requests, meaning OpenAI retains conversation data server-side
- Conversation context is sent to OpenAI's Responses compaction protocol
- Returned opaque compaction artifacts are stored in Pi's local session JSONL
- These artifacts are provider-native and not human-readable

## Configuration

Config is read from:

- `~/.pi/agent/openai-server-compaction.json` (global)
- `.pi/openai-server-compaction.json` (project-local, takes precedence)

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "includeAzure": false,
  "thresholdRatio": 0.7,
  "compactThreshold": 0,
  "usePreviousResponseId": true,
  "notify": false
}
```

Environment overrides:

| Variable                                           | Effect                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PI_OPENAI_SERVER_COMPACTION_ENABLED`              | Enable/disable the extension                                |
| `PI_OPENAI_SERVER_COMPACTION_AZURE`                | Include Azure OpenAI models                                 |
| `PI_OPENAI_SERVER_COMPACTION_THRESHOLD`            | Explicit compact threshold (tokens)                         |
| `PI_OPENAI_SERVER_COMPACTION_RATIO`                | Compact threshold as ratio of context window (default: 0.7) |
| `PI_OPENAI_SERVER_COMPACTION_PREVIOUS_RESPONSE_ID` | Enable/disable `previous_response_id`                       |
| `PI_OPENAI_SERVER_COMPACTION_NOTIFY`               | Show UI notifications when features activate                |

## Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong:

1. **Quick disable:** set `PI_OPENAI_SERVER_COMPACTION_ENABLED=0` or add `"enabled": false` to config
2. **Bypass entirely:** run Pi with `--no-extensions`
3. **Reload:** run `/reload` in Pi to re-initialize extensions
4. **Uninstall:** `pi remove pi-openai-server-compaction`
5. **Inspect:** check your session JSONL for `compaction` entries with `details.remoteCompaction` to see if remote compaction was recorded

## Testing

Smoke test (offline, verifies imports and key algorithms):

```bash
npm run smoke
```

Live end-to-end test (requires working Pi + OpenAI auth):

```bash
npm run test:live
```

Override the test model:

```bash
PI_OPENAI_SERVER_COMPACTION_TEST_MODEL=openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol npm run test:live
```

## Limitations

- Pi's local JSONL/tree model remains authoritative
- Opaque remote compaction artifacts are only reused for compatible OpenAI Responses turns
- Switching to a different provider/model falls back to Pi's text-summary portability path
- Compaction usage/cost is captured in details but not yet folded into Pi's `get_session_stats()` (requires Pi core changes)
